1. Explain the purpose of Node.js and its key features. How does its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model differ from traditional server-side models?

Solution->
Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It was built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is known for its high performance and efficiency.
The key features of Node.js include:

-   Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple connections simultaneously without blocking the execution. This makes it highly efficient and suitable for I/O-bound applications.
-   Non-Blocking I/O: The traditional server-side models use blocking I/O, in which the execution has to wait for an I/O operation to complete its tasks before moving on. However, Node.js uses non-blocking I/O, meaning that it can perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations.
-   Single-Threaded: Node.js is based on a single-threaded event loop. This makes it possible to handle many concurrent connections with ease. This is quite different from the traditional multi-threaded server-side models.

2. Describe the architecture of Node.js. How does the single-threaded event loop handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently?

Solution->
The architecture of Node.js is based on the single-threaded event loop. The event loop continually monitors events and executes callbacks based on events. It handles multiple concurrent requests as follows: - Event Loop: The event loop is a loop that runs continuously scanning for newly incoming events, and executes their corresponding callbacks. This mechanism ensures that the application responds correctly, with minimum response time, and allows for simultaneous handling of several requests. - Event Queue: When a request is made it is added to the event queue. The event loop then works to processes each event, execute the corresponding callback. - I/O Offloading: Node.js offloads I/O operations to the operating system, so that the event loop can continue to process other events. This means Node.js can serve a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

3. Outline the steps to install Node.js on your machine. How can you verify that Node.js is correctly installed and working?

4. What is npm, and why is it important in the Node.js ecosystem? Explain how you would manage dependencies in a Node.js project using npm.

5. Write a simple Node.js application that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the steps to run this application using the Node.js runtime.

6. What are Node.js modules? Describe how to create a custom module in Node.js and how to import it into another file.

7. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Node.js for building server-side applications.

8. Explain the role of the Node.js REPL and how it can be used for quick testing and debugging.

9. Provide a detailed explanation of the CommonJS module system in Node.js. How does it differ from ES6 modules?

10. Describe a real-world scenario where Node.js would be more advantageous to use compared to traditional server-side technologies.

### Node.js Modules and Packages

11. Explain the CommonJS module system in Node.js. How does it differ from ES6 modules? Provide examples to illustrate your answer.

12. Create a custom module in Node.js that exports a function to perform a specific task (e.g., adding two numbers). Demonstrate how to import and use this module in another file.

13. List and describe three built-in Node.js modules. Provide examples of how each module can be used in a Node.js application.

14. What is npm, and why is it important in the Node.js ecosystem? Explain how to install and manage packages using npm.

15. Describe the purpose of the package.json file in a Node.js project. What information does it contain, and why is it critical for managing dependencies?

16. Compare and contrast global and local npm packages. When would you choose to install a package globally instead of locally?

17. Explain how to find and use a third-party module in a Node.js application. Provide an example of installing and using a popular npm package (e.g., express).

18. Outline the steps required to publish a custom package to the npm registry. What are some best practices for managing versions and dependencies in your package?

19. Discuss the advantages and potential risks of using third-party modules in a Node.js application. How can you ensure the security and reliability of these modules?

20. Explain how to update and uninstall npm packages in a Node.js project. What should you be cautious about when updating packages?
